# NEXT

One milestone. One page. When it's done, rewrite this file.

**Test:** can I answer "what am I doing today?" in one sentence?

---

## Done: the entire database

**All five logical schema groups are migrated, tested and committed.**

| | Tables | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Group 1 | 10 | identity, roles, family, guardians, privacy |
| Group 2 | 20 | courses, versions, structure, enrolments, progress, assessments, completion, certificates |
| Group 3 | 20 | reviewers, review workflow, provenance, appeals, panels, audit |
| Group 4 | 18 | products, pricing, subscriptions, promotions, entitlements |
| Group 5 | 20 | orders, payments, refunds, reconciliation, payouts |
| **Total** | **88** | RLS on every table · 202 policies · 105 triggers · 82 functions |

**170 tests pass** against a real PostgreSQL engine: `npm run test:db`.

The record specified 85 tables. There are 88 because three were missing from
it and had to be added to make the recorded decisions implementable:
`institutions` (D1 multi-tenancy), `media_assets` (D8 media masters) and
`platform_settings` (without which "enable it later" had nowhere to live).

Every frozen decision is enforced in SQL rather than in application code:
**D1** · **D2** · **D4** · **D5** · **D6** · **D7** · **D8** · **D9**.

## Current milestone: the application layer — mostly done

`web/` is a Next.js 16 + TypeScript app with Supabase Auth wired, and one
authenticated screen reading through RLS.

### Also done since: the authorization matrix

`authorization_matrix: incomplete` was the last open Phase 1 item. It is now
derived from the migrations and written up in
`docs/decisions/authorization-matrix.md`, with
`supabase/tests/authorization.test.mjs` enforcing all ten of the record's
required access tests — two of which had no coverage anywhere.

Writing it down found three real defects, all fixed in
`20261021000100_authz_fixes.sql`:

1. a family `billing_manager` could read the children's profiles
2. an assigned reviewer could not read the content they were asked to review
3. **a verified guardian could not see the child they were verified for** —
   `guardian_relationships` was consulted by no policy at all, so the whole
   verification workflow gated nothing. That workflow is the machinery behind
   verifiable parental consent, which COPPA requires for US under-13s.

**190 tests pass.**

### Done

- [x] Next.js + TypeScript app, `npm run build` clean, 7 routes
- [x] Email+password **and** phone OTP (D3)
- [x] E.164 normalisation at the boundary, 7 unit tests
- [x] Sign-in, sign-up, confirmation and sign-out
- [x] `/learn` reads enrolments with **no client-side filter** — RLS decides
- [x] `supabase/tests/app.test.mjs` pins that data contract (177 tests total)
- [x] `.env.example`, no secrets committed

### Still open — needs a live Supabase project

This sandbox has no Supabase instance, so the app builds and renders but the
authentication round trip is unverified. Pointing `web/.env.local` at a real
project and confirming in a browser is the remaining step.

- [ ] Sign up with email, confirm, sign in
- [ ] Sign in with phone OTP; confirm the number arrives as E.164
- [ ] `/learn` shows only your own enrolments **in the browser**
- [ ] Apply the migrations to the real project with `supabase db push`

### Today's sentence

> Create the Supabase project, push the migrations, and confirm the auth round
> trip in a browser.

### Also done since: the catalogue and the visual identity

**White and green**, per the decision recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. The tokens
live in `web/src/app/globals.css` and nowhere else — changing the brand means
changing that one block.

`/catalogue` (search, subject filter, audience filter) and `/courses/[slug]`
(outline, sections, lessons, preview flags). `web/src/lib/catalogue.ts` holds
the query so the landing page and the catalogue cannot drift into two ideas of
what "on the shelf" means. `subject_areas` is seeded: 9 disciplines, 26
subdivisions, two levels — a deeper tree makes the filter unusable on a phone.

`supabase/tests/catalogue.test.mjs` pins the public contract, and found a
fourth defect: `courses_read` admitted any active course whether or not a
version had ever been published, so an author who set the wrapper to `active`
during drafting put the title and description of unpublished work on the
public internet. The app filtered it out, but a presentation filter is not an
access control. Fixed in `20261022000200_catalogue_visibility.sql`.

**198 tests pass.**

### Also done since: enrolment, and the payment boundary

Both at once, deliberately, because doing the first without the second would
have hidden the thing that mattered.

**Free enrolment works.** The course page resolves the offering from products
and prices rather than from a flag on the course, and `/api/enrol` takes a
course id and nothing else — no learner id, no price, no source. Every one of
those would have been a way to lie.

**The `PaymentProvider` boundary is real code**, not a comment.
`web/src/lib/payments/provider.ts` is the interface an adapter must satisfy;
`UnconfiguredPaymentProvider` is the provider that says no, and it stays in
the tree — an unconfigured deployment must keep behaving that way.
`web/src/lib/money.ts` is D4 in TypeScript: `bigint` minor units, and a float
is a type error rather than a silent truncation. 19 unit tests.

**A serious hole, found by wiring the button.** `course_enrolments_insert`
checked only `can_access_learner(learner_profile_id)` — that you may act for
the learner. It never asked whether the course was for sale. Any signed-in
user could POST an enrolment against a paid course with `source = 'free'` and
walk past the entire payment stack: no product, no price, no order, no
callback. The entitlement model was correct and simply never consulted at the
one moment it mattered. Fixed in `20261023000100_enrolment_gate.sql`;
`supabase/tests/enrolment.test.mjs` holds the negative cases.

**208 tests pass.**

### Also done since: progress and completion

`/learn` now shows a real progress bar per course, and `/learn/[enrolmentId]`
is the course view: sections, lessons, mark complete, undo. `POST
/api/progress` records it. Mark-complete is optimistic — a tick that waits on
a round trip feels broken on a slow connection, and ease of use is the first
design constraint.

Two things worth knowing about the model:

**Progress is pinned to the version the learner enrolled into.** Recording
progress against a lesson from a different version is refused by
`enforce_progress_version_match`. Publishing v2 leaves v1 progress untouched
and does not move anyone's enrolment. Both are pinned by tests.

**Completion is derived, not stored.** There is no `course_completions` table.
`evaluate_completion()` recomputes from recorded facts and returns what is
still blocking, so a completion report cannot drift out of sync with a
progress bar. `progress.test.mjs` asserts the table does not exist, so nobody
adds one by accident.

**219 tests pass.**

### What comes after that

The paid path. It needs a provider, and a provider needs merchant
registration and signed API terms (P12). Until then `payment_required` is the
honest answer and the UI says so.

Otherwise unblocked: **assessments** — quizzes, attempts and grading. The
tables, `grade_response()` and the answer-key column privilege all exist; only
the UI is missing. And **certificates** are staff-issued only
(`issue_certificate` requires a privileged actor or a support agent), so a
learner completing a course does not get one automatically — that is a
deliberate gate, and it will need a review step in the admin dashboard.

### Not now

Admin dashboard · payments UI · mobile · the investor proposal.

### Decisions still open that this milestone will surface

- **P11 — interfaces, not guesses.** The first screen needs the AyahSpring
  visual identity, which does not exist yet. Either design it now or build
  unstyled and accept rework.
- **P12 — the seven external facts.** Payment providers, jurisdiction,
  trademark clearance. Group 5 has the schema; the providers are still
  unchosen.
- **P6 consequence.** The scholarly panel is dormant. Before switching it on,
  decide whether anything published under peer review gets retroactive panel
  review or is grandfathered.
